  As well as module-level named functions, Gleam has anonymous function
  literals, written with the <code>fn() { ... }</code> syntax.

<p>Anonymous functions can be used interchangeably with named functions.</p>

  Anonymous functions can reference variables that were in scope when they were
  defined, making them <em>closures</em>.
