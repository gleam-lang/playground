<p>
  The <code>use</code> expression is syntactic sugar for a regular function call
  and an anonymous function.
</p>

<p>This code:</p>
<pre>
use a, b <- my_function
next(a)
next(b)
</pre>

<p>Expands into this code:</p>
<pre>
my_function(fn(a, b) {
  next(a)
  next(b)
})
</pre>

<p>
  To ensure that your <code>use</code> code works and is as understandable as
  possible, the right-hand-side ideally should be a function call rather than a
  pipeline or other expression, which is typically more difficult to read.
</p>

<p>
  <code>use</code> is an expression like everything else in Gleam, so it can be
  placed within blocks.
